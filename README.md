Developed a machine learning-based web application using Python to classify SMS and email messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam".
Implemented text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming), TF-IDF vectorization, and a Multinomial Naive Bayes
classifier. Built the frontend using HTML with Flask for backend integration, enabling real-time spam detection through a simple web
form.
